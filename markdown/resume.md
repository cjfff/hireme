> If you're looking for someone to take a leadership role, shaping the
> infrastructure and the architectural decisions that drive your developers
> productivity, let's talk.

Summary
-------

* Automation is always better than repetition.
* Information is key to making smart decisions.
* Fixing a problem correctly the first time is preferable to leaving it to
  resurface later, but getting things done is the most important part.
